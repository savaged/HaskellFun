# hello-world

Just trying out the Haskell Platform - stack

## first

Ran `stack new hello-world simple` (simple here is a stack template project)


## next

Just run `stack build` which creates an executable in a 'deep' directory in the project. The run `stack run` to execute that program and voil√†!
